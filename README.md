The entire repository is set up as a single devcontainer and can be run as a Codespace.

## Server Approaches

The [server-aspnet](/server-aspnet/) project uses C# and ASP.NET with controllers to provide a web API.

### Node and Express
The [server-node](/server-node/) project uses Node and the Express library to provide a web API.

## Client Approaches

### Vue
The [client-vue](/client-vue/) project uses the Vite development environment and Vue to provide a client-side app to consume one of the web APIs and provide a weather forecast.
